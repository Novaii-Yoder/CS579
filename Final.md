# Final
I created a knowledge graph using the list of terms provided, I started by using my note taking app Obsidian to write descriptions and connections of each term. I then ported everything over to Visio and created a pdf.

## Obsidian Files
Contains a .md file for each term with a small description and links to the other .md files. (Obsidian is really cool, you should take a look)
