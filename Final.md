# Final
I created a knowledge graph using the list of terms provided, I started by using my note taking app Obsidian to write descriptions and connections of each term. I then ported everything over to Visio and created a pdf.

# PDF
To make the PDF a little more readable, I removed some connections that seem less important that would have caused lines all the way across the graph. For example, PatchGuard is only available on 64bit windows systems, but the connection from PatchGuard to 64bit would have gone across a lot of other connections.

# Obsidian View
Obisdian provides an overview of the .md files and their links, it doesnt show titles (usually) or relationships.

## Obsidian Files
Contains a .md file for each term with a small description and links to the other .md files. (Obsidian is really cool, you should take a look)
