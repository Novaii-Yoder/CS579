The goal of the assignment was to create a anti-njrat tool that would stop all related processes and remove all files created by njrat. To do this I created a C# program in Visual Studio, I used one of the template provided by Visual Studio that had a form to start my program from. I then created 2 buttons, where the first scans for suspicious files and and processes and displays the second button if it finds any. The second button removes all the suspicious files and kills the processes.
